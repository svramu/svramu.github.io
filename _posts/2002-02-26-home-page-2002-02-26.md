**Launching in April 2002**

We strongly believe, that only unique value survives, come what may. We are equally certain, that defeat is merciless in pruning the unwanted. With survival as the litmus test, we prepare ourselves to give our best, and to do business, in every reasonable sense of that word. We do understand and accept our social responsibilities, and are eager to meet them.

We are a handful of novices, hoping to give value for value. We have ourselves given 2 years as the gestation period. Within which time we expect to do all our mistakes, hopefully in a correctable fashion, and progress.

Our agenda is ambitious, but have decided to stay with it, however ridiculous it may be now. To start with we'll be concentrating fully on **Solution Engineering** and **Distributed Application Architecture**. Our approach to it would be to simplify and clarify the motivation behind each principle and practice.

We are opening our *shop* in April 2002. We hope to interest you!
