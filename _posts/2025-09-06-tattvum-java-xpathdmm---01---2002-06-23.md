&{<nil> false <nil> <nil> [] <nil> <nil> <nil> <nil> # TATTVUM Java XPathDMM - 0.1 - (2002-06-23)

Post date: Nov 28, 2008 12:44:55 PM

*Note:* This is the initial PoPP release, containing the source. For further details please browse the code (not much comments there too, except the class model and the moderately modularized code). More documentation will come soon.

*Requirements:* I use 1.4 Java, but this program doesn't use any 1.4 specific API. So, ideally it should run in any 1.2+ JVM. Please mail me (svramu at TATTVUM) if you run into problems. I'll also be checking it this week, and update about bugs in the next hosting. Of course you need the latest release of Apache Java XALAN for this program to compile or run.

*Download the software:* TATTVUM-PoPP-TJXPathDMM-0.1-all.zip (~8k)

*To Run the demo:* Unzip the download and run the class `org.tattvum.core.xml.test.TestXPathDMM`
}
