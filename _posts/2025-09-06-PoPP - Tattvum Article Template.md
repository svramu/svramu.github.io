**Introduction**

For easing the article submission and the formatting of it for publication in the TATTVUM site, we encourage you to download this HTML Article template zip file. It contains the HTML pre-publication version of a TATTVUM article. You can use this tagging model for your own article, by suitably breaking your article into blocks, and copy pasting it in this template, before sending it to us. This will greatly simplify our work. This template is also a reasonably flexible model to streamline your own thinking process.
