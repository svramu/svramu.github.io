# Welcome to My Chirpy Blog!

This is the body of my first post using the **Chirpy** theme for Jekyll.

## Key Features

*   **Responsive Design:** Looks great on all devices.
*   **Markdown Support:** Easy to write and format content.
*   **Customization Options:** Tailor the theme to your needs.

### Code Example

```python
def hello_chirpy():
    print("Hello from Chirpy!")

hello_chirpy()
```
