Post date: Nov 28, 2008 12:37:57 PM

*Note:* This is the initial PoPP release, containing the source and the binary, and a batch file to run the demo. For further details please browse the code (not much comments there too, except the class model and the moderately modularized code). More documentation will come soon.

*Requirements:* I use 1.4 Java, but this program doesn't use any 1.4 specific API. So, ideally it should run in any 1.2+ JVM. Please mail me (svramu at TATTVUM) if you run into problems. I'll also be checking it this week, and update about bugs in the next hosting.

*Download the software:* TATTVUM-PoPP-TJRagam-0.1-all.zip (~31k)

*To Run the demo:* Execute the RunDemo.bat file in the downloaded zip.

*WARNING:* The song playback is off-beat for some reason, if not played in my JEdit editor! I know this is a serious problem, and will rectify it as soon as possible. I'm releasing the code only for interested coders.
