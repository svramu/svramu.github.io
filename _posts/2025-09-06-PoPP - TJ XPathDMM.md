**Introduction**

*XPathDMM (XPath Document Memory Model)* is an alternative and a very simple DOM interface, but equally expressive. This is based on the expressiveness of XPath. This program is just a wrapper implementation of this interface with the latest Apache Java XALAN package. Checkout this [TATTVUM article](XPathDMM%20-%20XPath%20Document%20Memory%20Model.html) for some details.
