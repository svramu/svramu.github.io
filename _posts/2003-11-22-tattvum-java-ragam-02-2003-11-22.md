The .sng file parser has been simplified drastically. Importantly, modified the old Listener like EventManager model to the, standard and, in this case, the very effective Builder Pattern. The .mid file creation is now working without the early slow-timing problem. It seems the 1.4.2 has corrected the off beat playback, when executed through a batch file.

The jEdit syntax coloring mode is included, if you are using JEdit (and know how to add a new mode). If so, add the following line in the jEdit catlog file, `<MODE NAME="Song" FILE="Song.xml" FILE_NAME_GLOB="*.sng" />`

*Requirements:* I use 1.4.2 Java's String.split() call, which uses the Regex package of 1.4 J2SE. (This helps me to remove my old manual chunking method and other dependencies)

*Download the software:* TJRagam-0.2-all-20031122.zip (~21k)

*To Run the demo:* Execute the RunDemo.bat file in the downloaded zip.
