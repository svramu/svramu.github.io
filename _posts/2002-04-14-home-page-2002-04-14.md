**Parallelism - The goal of planning** [Read this article]

Until the recent past, whenever I used to start on a project, and decided to 'Plan' something before starting coding, I used to get stuck. What should I plan about? Will not the requirements keep changing? Isn't direct coding, in small chunks, and in an iterative fashion, the best? But now, after some years of experience, slowly few things are becoming repetitively assertive...

So, when we embark on *Designing* a project, our prime goal should be to find what is the maximum number of people that we can put in the project, without wasting too much time on management issues...

The mark of extensibility of a project is the degree to which its internal relations are polymorphic. I'm unable to enumerate the exhaustive non-overlapping list of polymorphic needs of a project; but that should be possible as we mature further. For now, remembering to loose-couple inter-module dependency through interfaces and dynamic class loading, through a factory, is a decent insurance for usefulness of planning.
