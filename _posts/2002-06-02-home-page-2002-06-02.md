**XPathDMM - XPath Document Memory Model** [Read this Article]

DMM just means Document Memory Model. I just wanted to de emphasize the 'Object' part of the DOM. Otherwise, DMM also intends to be an in-memory XML representation. By removing the focus on objects, we also remove the dependency from the JFC based coding model, and move towards XPath based pattern matching. Come to think of it, I wonder why this is not already popular. Because with just 5-7 methods you can accomplish what you can with DOM and its plethora of interfaces and the deluge of methods in them. XPathDMM has only one interface and literally a handful of methods. But thanks to the power of XPath we can accomplish more than what a DOM promises even with such a simple set of methods.
