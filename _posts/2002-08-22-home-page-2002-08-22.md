**Regular Expressions and Compilers** [Read this article]

...regular expressions are really very expressive. But still they are very simple at their core. Most of its meta characters (* + | {} [] () . ?) are there only to simply few routine things ... But what is the minimum requirement for a regular expression? A [Regular Expression](https://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Regular_expression) just requires three things: *The* *(Kleene star),* *|* *(pipe) and the basic string concatenations.* There could be some variations on the above symbolism, but off late, all implementations keep Perl as the de facto standard for RE symbols and capabilities.

...The first time I read that *a restricted form of BNF is in fact the Regular Expression itself*, I was hooked. Here are two meta language that I've used a bit before, and both in the context of defining a string of characters. And here is some statement connecting them both. The crux is that I all along believed that RE and BNF is serving different ends (BNF for languages, and RE for strings), and hence are incomparable. In fact these two *are* different, and yes, BNF is more powerful than RE. But it is also true that both do have the spirit of a compiler in them. After all both match strings. The fact that, *a restricted form of BNF = RE*, only puts things in perspective. But how?
