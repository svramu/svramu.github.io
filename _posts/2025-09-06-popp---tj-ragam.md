**Introduction**

*Ragam* is a tune-defining concept in Indian classical music, especially in South India. This program accepts a coded song in a custom .sng (song) file, and plays it using Java MIDI package. The notation used for recording music in Ragam is a linear model, unlike the western staff notation. This is the traditional notation of Carnatic music, with some changes for computer usage.

The program should eventually allow full configuration, save the song in a .mid file, and play back as notated. Raga analysis, detection and random creations also should be possible.
